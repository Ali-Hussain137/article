we choose the dataset for our final porject of programming for big data from BBC news article.
there is two colomns and 2126 rows.
first row is for category of article and second row is for text of article. but in our project we will only use text colomn.
becasue we have to find category of article i.e: which article belong to which category. if a article is about sports or have any other category we will find that article is about sport.
our data storage is 4.82 MB.
